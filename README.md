# VFTModels

Verbal Fluency Task Analysis Tool using traditional rule-based, list-based and a novel semantic relatedness method.

This Github repository contains the code for the publication **XXXX**. Please refer to this publication for further details.

When using this software, please cite this work as: **XXXX**

This code allows:
1. training a Semantic Relatedness Model using a Wikipedia Corpus
2. Analyzing the words of a Verbal Fluency Task (VFT) using a Semantic Relatedness Model
3. Analyzing the words of a semantic Verbal Fluency Task (VFT) using traditional list-based clustering
4. Analyzing the words of a phonematic Verbal Fluency Task (VFT) using traditional rule-based clustering

# Requirements
